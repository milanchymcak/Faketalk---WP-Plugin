# FakeTalk Wordpress Plugin
Do you feel like the discussion at your posts is going nowhere? You can create, schedule, and publish 1000s of comments with real names, emails, and comments to get the party going. Think it's a kinda gray area? [Reddit started the same way with a lot of fake comments and accounts.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z4444w/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2 "How Reddit Got Huge: Tons of Fake Accounts")

## How it works?
1. Select Specific Post (Or you can target all your posts and add it randomly split between)
2. Add your own comments (spintax support available)
3. Choose the date range when your comments were published (so it doesn't look suspicous that all comments were posted in 1 day)
4. Add rating fields or your own custom meta keys (if your template supports it)
5. Publish!
